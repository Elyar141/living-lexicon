## üìä Notion Database Setup

Your Notion database should have the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `Name` | Title | The vocabulary word |
| `Brief Definition` | Text | A clear, concise definition |
| `Emotional Texture` | Text | Synonyms or related words |
| `Contextual Examples` | Text | 3 examples separated by double line breaks |
| `Status` | Select | Must include "Enriched" option |

**Important:** Only words with Status = "Enriched" will appear in the flashcard app.

### Example Entry

**Name:** Ephemeral

**Brief Definition:** Lasting for a very short time; temporary and fleeting in nature.

**Emotional Texture:** Fleeting, transient, momentary

**Contextual Examples:**
```
In the design podcast discussion about Snapchat's innovation, they emphasized how ephemeral content fundamentally changed user psychology around sharing.

The product team debated whether to implement ephemeral notifications that disappear after viewing, weighing the reduced cognitive load against potential information loss.

During the design critique, the mentor noted that trends in UI design are increasingly ephemeral, with popular patterns shifting every 6-12 months.
```

**Status:** Enriched

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file to configure:

```env
# Required: Your Notion integration token
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxxxx

# Optional: Server port (default: 3000)
PORT=3000
```

### Database ID

The database ID is hardcoded in `server.js`:
```javascript
databaseId: '2932ab6ea09280f19ff4ecca6b020371'
```

If you want to use a different database, update this value.

## üé® Customization

### Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `index.html` to customize colors:

```css
:root {
  --blob-color: 255, 140, 0;    /* Orange gradient blob */
  --bg: #ffffff;                /* Background */
  --text: #1c2b3a;              /* Text color */
  --border: rgba(28, 43, 58, 0.15); /* Button borders */
}
```

### Typography

Adjust font sizes:

```css
:root {
  --font-xl: clamp(48px, 8vw, 72px);  /* Main word */
  --font-lg: clamp(20px, 3vw, 28px);  /* Definition */
  --font-md: clamp(18px, 2.5vw, 24px); /* Texture */
  --font-sm: clamp(16px, 2vw, 20px);  /* Examples */
}
```

### Animation Speed

```css
:root {
  --speed: 42s;              /* Blob animation speed */

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Server Not Running" message

**Problem:** You opened `index.html` directly in browser (file://)

**Solution:** Run the server with `npm start` and visit http://localhost:3000

### "Setup Required" message

**Problem:** .env file is missing or NOTION_API_KEY is not set

**Solution:**
1. Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. Add your Notion integration token
3. Restart the server

### "Invalid Notion API token" error

**Problem:** Token is incorrect or database not shared with integration

**Solution:**
1. Verify token in .env file is correct
2. Make sure you shared your database with the integration in Notion
3. Restart the server after changing .env

### "No Words Found" message

**Problem:** No entries with Status = "Enriched" in database

**Solution:**
1. Open your Notion database
2. Set Status to "Enriched" for words you want to study
3. Refresh the app

### Port already in use

**Problem:** Port 3000 is already being used by another application

**Solution:** Change the port in `.env`:
```env
PORT=3001
```

---

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env` file** - It contains your secret API token
- **Never share your .env file** - Keep your token private
- **Server only accepts localhost** - API token endpoint only works locally
- **Use git-ignored .env** - The .gitignore file excludes .env by default

---

## üíæ Data & Privacy

- **Progress stored locally** - Your learning progress is saved in browser localStorage
- **No data sent to external servers** - All data stays between your browser and Notion
- **Read-only access** - App only reads from Notion, never modifies your database
- **Clear progress** - Click "Reset Progress" to clear all mastered words

---

## üîÑ Reset Progress

To reset all your progress and start fresh:

1. **Option 1:** Click "Reset Progress" button when all words are mastered
2. **Option 2:** Clear localStorage in browser DevTools:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('livingLexicon_mastered')
   ```
3. **Option 3:** Use incognito/private browsing mode

---

## üìù Development

### Running in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Making changes

1. Edit `index.html` for UI/styling changes
2. Edit `server.js` for backend changes
3. Changes to HTML/CSS are instant (just refresh browser)
4. Changes to server.js require server restart

---

## üö¢ Deployment

This app is designed to run locally. If you want to deploy it:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**Do NOT deploy this to a public server** with your API token in .env. The current setup is **only secure for localhost**.

If you need a hosted version, you would need to:
1. Implement proper authentication
2. Store API tokens securely (database, not .env)
3. Add user accounts
4. Use HTTPS
5. Implement rate limiting
