# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference - Flashcard App

## Copy-Paste This Into New Claude Code Chat:

```
I need you to build a vocabulary flashcard web application. Here are the requirements:

BUILD: Single self-contained HTML file (no external dependencies)

DESIGN:
- Premium aesthetic with moving orange gradient blob background (subtle, slow animation)
- White background (#ffffff), dark blue-gray text (#1c2b3a)
- Large bold word (48-72px), smaller emotional texture (18-24px)
- Minimal border-only buttons
- Smooth 3D card flip animation (600ms)
- Hover-reveal navigation arrows on edges

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Fetch vocabulary from Notion API (Database ID: 2932ab6ea09280f19ff4ecca6b020371)
- Filter by Status = "Enriched"
- Front: Show word + emotional texture + "Reveal" button
- Back: Show word + definition + 3 examples + "Got It!" button
- Navigate with arrow keys, hover arrows, or swipe (mobile)
- Space bar to flip card
- Track progress with localStorage (mark words as mastered)
- Show progress counter (5/130)
- Don't show mastered words again

DATA STRUCTURE FROM NOTION:
- Name (title): The vocabulary word
- Brief Definition (text): Short definition
- Emotional Texture (text): Synonyms/related words
- Contextual Examples (text): 3 examples separated by \n\n
- Status (select): Filter for "Enriched"

RESPONSIVE:
- Desktop: Keyboard shortcuts, hover arrows
- Mobile: Touch/swipe gestures, tap to flip

ERROR HANDLING:
- Show friendly message if no API key
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Show loading state
- Handle empty states

USER SETUP:
- User provides Notion integration token
- Must share database with integration
- Paste token into HTML file

The app should feel premium, smooth, and polished. Build it production-ready!
